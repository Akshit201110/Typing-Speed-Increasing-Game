# Typing Speed Game 
This project is a Python-based Typing Speed Game designed to improve typing skills while demonstrating strong logic-building and program structuring abilities.

Key Features:

Logic Building:
The game logic involves generating random words or sentences, capturing real-time user input, calculating typing speed (words per minute), and measuring typing accuracy. Algorithms are implemented to track the time taken, count correctly typed characters or words, and provide immediate feedback to the user.

User Interaction:
The game offers an interactive environment where users can start typing as soon as the prompt appears. It dynamically updates the score based on typing speed and correctness, enhancing the user's learning experience.

Real-Time Feedback and Score Calculation:
The system records the start and end time of the typing session to compute Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage. Logic is built to compare typed input with the original prompt and give detailed results.

Scalability and Extensibility:
The modular structure of the program allows easy extension, such as adding difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), displaying typing history, integrating a timer countdown, or offering leaderboard functionalities.
